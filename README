This is to put the operational ENSO forecast.
all compling is done: pgf78 *

(1) download the data from internet.

windstress: (a) run readfsuwind.f (./data) to transfer data into
                unformatted format.
            (b) run modelwind.f (./data) to interpolate FSU to the 
                model grid.
            (c) the wind data is put in ~tym/linux/model_data 
                using 'cat' comment to prolong the wind data           

ssh: (a)   download the ncep ssh data.
           run read_ssh.f to get anomaly data for assimilation. 

(2) do forecast

    (a) using the model ~/ENSO_forecast/model/model_assh1

(3) after finishing the prediction, to run ~/enso_forecast/fortran/index_2.for
    to extract the NINO3 index, and using ~/enso_forecast/matlab/plot_final.m
    to plot the nino3 curve. The observed NINO3 index is from NCEP.
    
(4) go to ~enso_forecast/fortran/spatial_case_predic.f to run fortran 
    program to get the spatial prediction and then use Grads to plot it. 

(5) go to ~/output to modefy t.ctl and ss.gs before
    run Grads. Using "wi test.gif" (or printim test.gif )command to 
    convert graphics into image GIF file in Grads envrionment.  

(6) Finaly to go to www/enso.html to update the prefiction.
